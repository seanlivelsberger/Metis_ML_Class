## Level 1 material

In Level 1 of the course you will build essential and practical machine learning (ML) skills.  You will grow your ML intuition regarding the most popular algorithms via interactive demonstrations that you will actively be involved in building.   Along the way you will learn how to use a widely used open source ML library - scikit-learn - as well as other crucial libraries - pandas and matplotlib.

To get started, follow the instructions from Parts 0 and 1 for installing all of the necessary files and libraries from [this set of instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_W4W8t2lUxDdKfW7E8diglBjmZUz9EIbFqQq9_AFBro/edit?usp=sharing).  Peruse the contents of Parts 2 and 3 as well, as they contain valuable information about where to find open source ML libraries, datasets, and developer tools.
